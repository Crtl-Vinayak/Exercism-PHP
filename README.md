# Exercism-PHP
PHP exercises :D

## How I installed CLI on my windows:

- https://exercism.org/docs/using/solving-exercises/working-locally
- https://github.com/exercism/windows-installer

1. Replace \<your-api-token\> value:<br>
exercism configure --token=\<your-api-token\>

2. Go to root folder in cmd (my root folder: ../Exercism-PHP/) and download exercise:<br>
exercism download --exercise=\<exercise-slug\> --track=\<track-slug\>

3. Done with exercise, submit exercise (change /hello-world/HelloWorld.php with the relevant exercise file/folder):<br>
exercism submit php/hello-world/HelloWorld.php

4. Check exercise on the website and go to iteration if you have failed/succeeded the test!<br>
